   <div class="box">LPG</div>
   <p>Indian Oil played the major role in India's transition to cleaner fuels when it started marketing Liquified Petroleum Gases (LPG) from its Barauni refinery in 1965. Brand Indane was conceived in 1964 to bring modern cooking to Indian kitchens and the first Indane LPG connection was released on 22nd October 1965 at Kolkata. From a humble beginning of a consumer base of around 2,000, the brand has grown into a super brand that rules nearly 1 billion kitchens. Today Indane has become one of the largest packed-LPG brands in the world. It is a fuel synonymous with safety, reliability and convenience.</p>
   <p>Today, Indane LPG is sold and delivered in five different pack sizes. The 5kg and 14.2 kg cylinders for domestic use are subsidized and comprise almost half of all gas distributed while the 19kg, 47.5 kg and 425 kg Jumbo cylinders are marked for industrial and commercial consumption. Indane LPG is also supplied in bulk to large volume consumers in the manufacturing and engineering sectors.</p>
   <p>As per a WHO report, smoke inhaled by women from unclean fuel is equivalent to burning 400 cigarettes in an hour. In addition, women and children have to go through the drudgery of collecting firewood. Indane has helped to do away the smoky environment of cooking which has led to a substantial improvement in the health of the nation. Besides this it has also led to the preservation of the environment by limiting the use of conventional fuels like firewood.</p>
   <p>In an effort to improve LPG penetration in the country and in order to help improve the lives of rural masses, in December 2015, Indian Oil has undertaken the task of achieving 100% LPG penetration in the country with a missionary zeal and the country's first smokeless village - Vyachakurahalli in Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka has entered into the Limca Book of Records-2017, after all households switched from conventional fuel to LPG.</p>
